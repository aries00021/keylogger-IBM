# keylogger-IBM

Key loggers are software tools that can record every keystroke made on a computer. They are used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring employee computer activity and catching cheating spouses. This presentation will explore the use and implications of Key logger technology. The given code is a basic implementation of a key logger using the Tkinter library and the pynput. The Tkinter library is used to create the GUI(Graphical User Interface), and the pynput library is used to listen to keyboard and Mouse events. The keylogger captures all the keystrokes from the keyboard and mouse and logs the key strokes in a text file or json file.
